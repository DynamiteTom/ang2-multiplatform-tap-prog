# Angular Multi-Platform Starter

The Angular Multi-Platform Starter is a cloneable template for building apps for the web, for native mobile with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/), and for desktop with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). The template contains a series of npm scripts for running your apps in these environments, as well as a set of conventions for sharing and forking your code for each ecosystemâ€”web, native mobile, and desktop.

Visit our [**documentation hub**](https://jlooper.github.io/angular-starter/) for detailed information on this starter.
